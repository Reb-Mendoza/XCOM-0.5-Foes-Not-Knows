# XCOM-0.5-Foes-Not-Knows

## Project Documentation

#### 12/1/22
1. Did research on A-Frame.
2. Looked up 3D models online: they needed to be free, relevant, and animated.
3. Envisioned the aesthetic of the game first, since the game's mechanics are already robotic and algorithmic, and should be relatively easy to implement.
4. Grown an expectation that point #3 is probably completely wrong and I should be working on other things.

#### 12/2/22
1. Did a lot more work on aesthetics anyways.
2. The work paid off as I managed to implement an animated 3D model into my scene!
3. Its very important to import the correct scripts for the project, else things will not work and you won't know why.
4. For this same reason, every time you import a script, test it.
