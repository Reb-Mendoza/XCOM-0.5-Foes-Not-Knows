# XCOM-0.5-Foes-Not-Knows

## Project Documentation

#### 12/1/22
1. Did research on A-Frame.
2. Looked up 3D models online: they needed to be free, relevant, and animated.
3. Envisioned the aesthetic of the game first, since the game's mechanics are already robotic and algorithmic, and should be relatively easy to implement.
4. Grown an expectation that point #3 is probably completely wrong and I should be working on other things.

#### 12/2/22
1. Did a lot more work on aesthetics anyways.
2. The work paid off as I managed to implement an animated 3D model into my scene!
3. Its very important to import the correct scripts for the project, else things will not work and you won't know why.
4. For this same reason, every time you import a script, test it.

#### 12/3/22
1. Searched up 2D assets online that I could use for the 3D portion of the game, i.e., wall and floor textures.
2. I have realized that the HUD and most of the UI will need to be 2D, and as its the most important part of the game, I will begin working on that.

#### 12/4/22
1. Mostly took a break.
2. During that break, I thought up ways the core game can work. What makes weapons different from one another? How to the enemies behave? Is it possible to implement a basic AI? Maybe the strategy is more fun if the enemies have a set pattern, and are more powerful to compensate for their stupidity.

#### 12/5/22
1. Added HUD elements.
2. Figured it would be easiest to add a blank rectangular plane first for a textbox; it can be a stylized image later, if there's time.

#### 12/6/22
1. Began coding the game itself.
2. This included getting together variables that I would need to have the game function.
3. Not sure if I will have time to implement a menu, so for now I am just going to try to get something playable.
4. My eventual plan is to have 3 military operators in the player's control at once, but for now I am going to try to get just one.

#### 12/7/22
1. I spent 14 hours getting the full sight system to work. I have a series of massive functions that allow me to check whether or not two tiles have line of sight within eachother.

#### 12/8/22
1. Learned more about A-frame, and exactly how it works.
2. Worked on visual things, like the actual battlefield.

#### 12/9/22
1. Took a break, but made a framework for what work is to come.
2. Made a realization that if I'm going to finish this project, I'd have to really get to work this next week.
3. Managed to get keyboard controls to respond.
4. Tomorrow I will hopefully be able to map every key I want to have mapped. WASD Camera Movement, 1-6 for unit actions, ESC for pause.

#### 12/10/22
1. Slacked off for half the day, but the night will go crazy.
2. Did work on key mapping and the logic of controlling the game as a whole.

#### 12/11/22
1. Big day. Time to grind out this thing for hours.
2. Did, and still am, doing a lot of work. I've decided that a lot of the fuctions of the buttons other than the first two are not required to have a working game. I will perhaps come back to them at a later time, but for the purposes of the project, I'll need to make some compromises.
3. Will need a function that converts the 2D coordinate system to the 3D one. Once the processing coordinates and the coordinates for everything visual are synced, things should be easy.

#### 12/13/22

#### 12/14/22
1. Wow I've been debugging for three days straight, and I don't have much to show for it other than that movement works.
2. I should have the framework I need to make a working game now, though.
3. It's time to make something out of what I've created; it will be very different from what I originally thought.

#### 12/15/22
1. There is no more time to introduce voilence to the game, it is now a hide and seek simulator. Awesome.
2. I had fun anyways, and I will 100% be working on this project on and off for years; I mean if I've been thinking about it for years, why not work on it for years?
