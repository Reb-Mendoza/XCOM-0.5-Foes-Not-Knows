# XCOM-0.5-Foes-Not-Knows

## Project Documentation

#### 12/1/22
1. Did research on A-Frame.
2. Looked up 3D models online: they needed to be free, relevant, and animated.
3. Envisioned the aesthetic of the game first, since the game's mechanics are already robotic and algorithmic, and should be relatively easy to implement.
4. Grown an expectation that point #3 is probably completely wrong and I should be working on other things.

#### 12/2/22
1. Did a lot more work on aesthetics anyways.
2. The work paid off as I managed to implement an animated 3D model into my scene!
3. Its very important to import the correct scripts for the project, else things will not work and you won't know why.
4. For this same reason, every time you import a script, test it.

#### 12/3/22
1. Searched up 2D assets online that I could use for the 3D portion of the game, i.e., wall and floor textures.
2. I have realized that the HUD and most of the UI will need to be 2D, and as its the most important part of the game, I will begin working on that.

#### 12/4/22
1. Mostly took a break.
2. During that break, I thought up ways the core game can work. What makes weapons different from one another? How to the enemies behave? Is it possible to implement a basic AI? Maybe the strategy is more fun if the enemies have a set pattern, and are more powerful to compensate for their stupidity.
